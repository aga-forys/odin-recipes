<p>This decadent chocolate and banana loaf cake is gorgeously moist from the fruit, whilst chocolate adds richness. Top with ganache and banana chips.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>100ml sunflower oil, plus extra to grease</li>
    <li>175g caster sugar</li>
    <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>Â½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
    <li>4 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
    <li>100g chocolate chips or chunks</li>
    <li>175g very ripe bananas</li>
    <li>3 medium eggs, 2 separated</li>
    <li>50ml milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the topping:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>100g milk chocolate</li>
    <li>100ml soured cream</li>
    <li>handful dried banana chips, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and line a 2lb loaf tin with baking parchment (allow it to come 2cm above top of tin). Mix the sugar, flour, bicarb, cocoa and chocolate in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Mash the bananas in a bowl and stir in the whole egg plus 2 yolks, followed by the oil and milk. Beat the egg whites until stiff. Quickly stir the wet banana mixture into the dry ingredients, stir in a quarter of the egg whites to loosen the mixture, then gently fold in the rest. Gently scrape into the tin and bake for 1 hr 10-15 mins, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Cool in the tin on a wire rack. To make the icing, melt the chocolate and soured cream together in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Chill in the fridge until spreadable. Remove cake from tin, roughly swirl icing over and scatter with the banana chips.</li>
